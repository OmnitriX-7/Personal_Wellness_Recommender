# Personal_Wellness_Recommender
1. Initial Setup & Imports
The code begins by importing all necessary Python libraries:

Core data handling with Pandas and NumPy

Machine learning components from scikit-learn (models, preprocessing, pipelines)

Visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Utility libraries (datetime, random, os)

Warning suppression to ignore non-critical sklearn warnings

2. Synthetic Data Generation
Creates realistic health profiles through:

10,000 sample records covering diverse health metrics

Demographic variables: Age (18-60), BMI (17-35)

Lifestyle factors: Sleep patterns, workout routines, stress levels

Physiological metrics: Heart rate, blood pressure, hydration

Target recommendations: Nutrition plans, fitness suggestions, supplements

Implements smart correlations:

BMI influences activity levels (higher BMI â†’ less active)

Stress impacts sleep quality and mood

Activity level determines suggested step counts

3. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
Feature engineering:

Converts time strings ("06:30") to numerical minutes (390)

Handles missing/invalid time formats with median imputation

Feature type segregation:

Identifies numerical vs. categorical features automatically

Numerical: Age, BMI, sleep hours (standardized via z-score)

Categorical: Diet type, workout style (one-hot encoded)

ColumnTransformer:

Applies appropriate transformations to each feature type

Maintains non-transformed columns via 'passthrough'

4. Machine Learning Architecture
Multi-output regression model:

Predicts continuous targets (calories, macros, sleep duration)

Uses Random Forest with 150 decision trees

Implements MultiOutputRegressor for parallel prediction

Classification models:

Separate Random Forest classifiers for categorical targets

Predicts workout types and meal timing advice

Balanced class weights handle imbalanced categories

Hyperparameters:

max_depth=20 prevents overfitting

min_samples_split=8 ensures robust splits

random_state=42 for reproducibility

5. Model Training & Evaluation
Data splitting:

75-25 train-test split with stratified sampling

Random state fixed for consistent evaluation

Performance metrics:

Regression: RMSE and MAE for each numerical target

Classification: Precision, recall, F1-score per category

Training process:

Fits preprocessing steps and models in single pipeline

Handles all feature transformations automatically

6. User Interaction System
Input methods:

Predefined default profile

Manual data entry with validation

Random sampling from dataset

Input validation:

Numeric range checking

Time format verification (HH:MM)

Categorical option validation

Prediction workflow:

Applies identical preprocessing to user input

Generates both regression and classification outputs

Formats recommendations for readability

7. Visualization & Explainability
Comparative analysis:

Histograms show user's metrics vs population distribution

Bar plots for categorical feature frequencies

Custom styling:

Highlights user's position in distributions

Clean, publication-quality visualizations

Interpretability:

Helps users understand recommendation basis

Shows how their profile compares to norms

8. Execution Flow
